# Possum2

[Possum2](https://github.com/lavignes/possum2) is the sequel project to [Possum](https://github.com/lavignes/possum),
a z80-based retro computer emulator. Possum2 is an attempt to further simplify and purify the
project. Possum cut a lot of corners and focused too much on its silly proto-CGA graphics chip.
